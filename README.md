## üçÑ Project's philosophy

This is a simple project demonstrating how to create a real time multiplayer game on the browser without need for any fancy frameworks.

<br/>


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure and run locally

### Requirements:

- Node.js 14 or above ([Instalation instructions](https://nodejs.org))

Before starting, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. To check the Node.js version installed on your machine, run the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

> [!TIP]
> If your Node.js version is not 14 or above, it is recommended to use `nvm`, which allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on your machine.
>
> [Repository with installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

### Running the application

Clone the repository locally. Then, navigate to the directory of the cloned repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mateus-sartorio/nine-lives-nine-balls
cd nine-lives-nine-balls
```

In the project directory, install all Node.js dependencies with the command:

```bash
npm install
```

After the installation finishes, you can start the project in development mode with:

```bash
npm run dedv
```

If everything went well, you are now running the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
